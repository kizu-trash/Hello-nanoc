# Hello, nanoc!

Just one my template for static projects. I'll try to update it as often as possible, right now it's just an early draft.

Someday, I'll write something about what I've done with it, but right now head to [nanoc's website](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) â€” they have some cookies for you.

## Installation
1. [Install](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/2-installation/) nanoc and all the dependencies (`sudo gem install nanoc3 builder mime-types maruku haml` if you have ruby and gems already installed)
2. `git clone git://github.com/kizu/Hello-nanoc.git HelloNanoc`
3. `cd HelloNanoc; nanoc aco`
4. Goto [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in browser.
5. Start building whatever you want placing pages in `content` folder
6. If something goes wrong read [nanoc's manual](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/)
